    ## React Theme Context
    
    This is a simple [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) shared as a Bit component.
    Use this component to share data between components without having to pass props down manually at every level.
    
    ### Component usage
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  ResponsiveProvider,
  useResponsive,
} from '@org-name/scope-name.context.responsive';

/* demo component */
const DisplayLanguage = () => {
  const { language } = useResponsive();
  if (language === 'en') return Hi!;
  return Hola!;
};

export const BasicUsage = () => {
  return (
    <ResponsiveProvider language="sp">
    <DisplayLanguage />
  </ResponsiveProvider>
  );
};
